RIMACS 1.0
----------

RIMACS is a C++ library for efficient computation
of the maximum common substructure problem.
The algorithm employs a recursive backtracking
scheme inspired by subgraph algorithms, mapping
nodes of two graphs directly onto each other.
It is designed for chemical graphs with limited
node degrees.

It is developed at the
Universitaet Hamburg, ZBH - Center for Bioinformatics
by Robert Schmidt and Matthias Rarey.

The library is distributed under BSD New license,
see the file LICENSE and [BSD New]
(https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).

See INSTALL or documentation for detailed installation
instructions.

The detailed documentation can be found in folder
`documentation` as HTML and PDF document.
